        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Information You Provide</strong>. We receive and store
          information you enter. For example, when you search for or buy a
          product or service, or when you supply information such as your
          address, phone number or credit card. You can choose not to provide
          certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage
          of some of our features. We use the information that you provide for
          such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future
          shopping for you, improving our website, and communicating with you.
          In addition, if you choose, we may share your information with other
          companies who provide goods or services that you are interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cookies.</strong> Like many websites, we use “cookies”.
          Cookies are small programs that we transfer to your hard drive that
          allow us to recognize you and to provide you with a customized
          shopping experience. If you do not want us to use cookies, you can
          easily disable them by going to the toolbar of your web browser, and
          clicking on the “help” button. Follow the instructions that will
          prevent the browser from accepting cookies, or set the browser to
          inform you when you receive a new cookie. In addition, you may visit
          this and other websites anonymously through the use of utilities
          provided by other private companies.

        <h2 className="privayc-title">2. How Do We Use Your Information?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Agents.</strong> We may employ other companies and individuals
          to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering
          packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, and processing credit card
          payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform
          their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Business Transfers</strong>. As we continue to develop our
          business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions,
          customer information generally is one of the transferred business
          assets. Also, in the unlikely event that we are acquired, customer
          information will be one of the transferred assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Law Enforcement</strong>. If we receive a lawful court order
          to release account or other personal information then we will comply
          with the law. We will also release information when necessary to
          protect the life, safety or property of others. This includes
          exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
          fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

          3. How Do We Protect the Security of Your Information?
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We work to protect the security of your information during
            transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
            encrypts information you input.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use encryption to protect your information contained in our
            customer list.
          </li>
          <li>We use a firewall to protect against unlawful intrusion.</li>
          <li>
            We limit access to your information on a “need to know” basis.
          </li>
          <li>
            We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when
            confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card
            number to the appropriate credit card company during order
            processing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your
          password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using
          a shared computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          No system can guarantee absolute security, just as the finest lock can
          not guarantee physical security. However, we take every reasonable
          precaution to assure that your data is secure.
